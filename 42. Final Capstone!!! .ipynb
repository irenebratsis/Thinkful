    "## What is the problem you are attempting to solve?\n",
    "<br> \n",
    "I want to see if it makes sense to buy or rent in NY/MA/CT next year. The project goals are to bring visibility into the rental and housing market in NY MA and CT and to shed light on the factors that would impact the decision to buy given projected performance of that investment 5 or 10 years into the future using economic data from the Federal Reserve as well as Zillow data. \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "## How is your solution valuable?\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "This problem would impact those that are in a position to buy but are not yet sure if the market has bottomed out and if it makes sense to rent for a bit longer. Given the significance in my own life, these three states are the locations I will be looking at specifically. This product would thus be valuable to anyone that is in a similar position of looking at the east coast and attempting to make a big decision as to where to live and where would bring the most potential (from a location and investment perspective). The inputs that I can take from the user would be things like priorities of surrounding areas like proximity to schools or highways or public transportation.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is your data source and how will you access it?\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Zillow data combined with interest rate/unemployment/inflation data. I already have the datasets I need.  They will be sourced from the below links:\n",

    "The variables I will be looking at the interest rates data, location and listing information for Massachusetts, New York and Connecticut specifically. I may also be scraping data from google maps for proximity to major cities to get commute times. \n",

    "\n",
    "## What techniques from the course do you anticipate using?\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "After EDA, cleaning and feature engineering, I will be using the economics specialization for this project, so I will be relying primarily on linear regression (Probit and Tobit) and robust regression (Huber, Thiel-Sen, and RANSAC) to assume performance gains or losses in 5 or 10 years in the future in buying vs renting scenarios as these long term projections would help with making a decision. I will try all these models and see which performs best. I can use K means clustering to create profiles around particular county profiles that would be most advantageous based on proximity to Boston and NYC, as well as schools, public transport and highways. I can also highlight certain counties or towns as suggestions based on this clustering.\n",

I can save that to raw json to different files. Can save it to a new df if i want. Save it as a python list. Where each element is JSON data. Potentially if we have a lot of rows that we're generating requests for we might have an issue with rate limits and it might take a while to run. Could put in delays between requests. \n",
